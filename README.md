## Hi! My name is Elena!

I started learning programming in high school (we used Pascal back then). After school, I chose a different path and got my BS and MS in Metallurgical Engineering from South Ural State University (Russia). However, after moving to the US, I needed a career change and in 2021, I saw an opportunity to take coding bootcamp programming course where we learned Python (Django), Java (Spring Boot) and Java Script (MERN) stacks over 6 months. But I felt like I lacked the basic knowledge and skills, and decided to grow as a software engineer and get my BS in Computer Science (Software Engineering specialization) from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

I had a great experience working as a junior Software Developer at a startup company Rumata, LLC. I still had bills to pay, so it was only part-time job, while I worked full-time in logistics and finished my degree at SNHU. But I am so glad I did it!
